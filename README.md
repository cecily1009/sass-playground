# sass-playground
play the features of sass...
# Variables
You now can reuse the variables in css (color, fontstyles...), like javascript syntax: $val_name: value;
# Nesting
You now can nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Make your stylesheets clear...
# Partials
You now can divide the stylesheet file into different part, by name the partial files "_partialfilename.scss". Then can be improted in other scss file. Becareful the order for scss is from top to buttom, buttom style will overwrite the top styles.

# Mixin
You now can make groups of CSS declarations that you wanna reuse throughout your site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. 

# Extend
Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very DRY.
